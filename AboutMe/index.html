    <div class="h1">About Me</div>
    <div class="p1">Hey! My name is Tyler, or tyyy online. I'm a 13 year old gamer and programmer.<br>I am from the North West of England, and have AWFUL wifi.<br> I like to play FIVEM / GTA RP quite a lot, with some of my friends in call.</div>
    <div class="h1">Coding Background</div>
    <div class="p1">I started off coding on python! I liked to make simple console games, such as diceroll and story games with several outcomes.<br> I then moved onto web development, following tutorials online, making browser games like tic tac toe.<br> I didn't do this for very long though as it didn't really interest me. After this, I began making discord servers,<br>and realised things like MEE6 and Dyno were costing quite alot for their premium features,<br>so instead I decided to learn how to make my own bots with Javascript. I learned javascript few a few years and now here I am!</div>
    <div class="h1">Hobbies</div>
    <div class="p1">I don't have any hobbies, mainly just coding. However, I do like to play football in the net.</div>
